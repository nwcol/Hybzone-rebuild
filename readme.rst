Hybzones
=========

This is a spatially explicit ecological simulation written to investigate the relationship between assortative mating, dispersal models, and genetic structure in a hybrid zone between interbreeding taxa.

Documentation is currently minimal. It is possible that the simulation will be available as an installable package in the future.
